# Simple Student Course Enrollment System
The system can help students to register themselves in available courses. It is implemented using C++ OOP.
The main system actors are:
1. Admin
2. Student
3. Professor

The system asks the user whether he wants to login as admin or student or professor. Once chosen, a list of all available operations is displayed according to the chosen user type. This
options list must be displayed after the completion of each operation till the user chooses to exit.
